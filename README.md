# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

This Python-based project explores the intersection of mental health discussions and various topic discourse on Twitter. Leveraging sentiment analysis, machine learning techniques, and topic modeling, we analyze user-generated content to unravel the emotional variations embedded in tweets.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify tweets into categories such as Positive, Negative, Emotional Struggles, etc.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilize Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression models for sentiment classification.
- **Topic Modeling:** Uncover latent topics within tweets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Data Visualization:** Generate word clouds, horizontal bar charts, and other visualizations to understand prevalent themes.

## Challenges Faced
- Limited access to live Twitter data due to API cost constraints.
- Directory management issues, navigating permissions even in administrator mode.

## Datasets
Explore a diverse range of datasets from Kaggle, ranging from 10,000 to over a million tweets, providing rich and varied content.

## How to Use
1. Download the repository.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook.
3. Upload the "Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Mental Health - Fardin Ahmed" file.
4. When you run the program for the first time, a new directory called "Twitter Data" will be created in the Jupyter Notebook environment as well as sub-directories.
5. Navigate to the directory where the "Twitter Data" folder is created and located.
6. Click on the "New" button and select "Folder" to create a new folder named "Twitter Data".
7. Once the folder is created, the user can click on it to open it.
8. Inside the "Twitter Data" folder, the user can click on the "Upload" button to upload your file.
9. Run the main program, adjusting parameters as needed.

## Sample Tweets
Check the 'sample_tweets' folder for a collection of tweets that showcase the program's capabilities.
I suggest you upload more datasets containing more tweets since I am unable to upload large datasets for sampling before you run my program.
Additional datasets can be found in Kaggle.com

## Acknowledgments
This project was made possible by the valuable datasets from Kaggle and the power of Python libraries such as NLTK, Scikit-Learn, and Gensim.
