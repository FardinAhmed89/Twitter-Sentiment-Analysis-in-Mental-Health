# Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Mental Health

1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Upload the Senior Project - Fardin Ahmed file.
3. When you run the program for the first time, a new directory called "Twitter Data" will be created in the Jupyter Notebook environment as well as sub-directories.
4. Navigate to the directory where the "Twitter Data" folder is created and located.
5. Click on the "New" button and select "Folder" to create a new folder named "Twitter Data".
6. Once the folder is created, the user can click on it to open it.
7. Inside the "Twitter Data" folder, the user can click on the "Upload" button to upload your file.

A sample dataset has been provided here in this github. You are free to download more dataset. 
Additional datasets can be found in Kaggle.com

I suggest you upload more datasets containing more tweets since I am unable to upload large datasets for sampling before you run my program.
